## `<Dropdown />`
#### props:
 ```
    isOpen: boolean
    checkDOMUpdate?: boolean
	maxHeightDefined?: number
    children: ReactNode
 ```
#### props in detail:
  - **isOpen**
    - in most cases the only option you need to define to make this work
  - **maxHeightDefined**
    - detecting element.offsetHeight comes with layout reflow expense, this option will help you prevent it
    - we might ask for the content to load on Dropdown open, in that case, we won't know the content height upfront
  - **checkDOMUpdate**
    - if Dropdown children are deeply nested, the dropdown might not be able to detect changes inside dropdown - e.g adding an item to a list
    - you enable this option and the Dropdown will detect any changes inside the Dropdown DOM. It comes at the performance expense of course.
